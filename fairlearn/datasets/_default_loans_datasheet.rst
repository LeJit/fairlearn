UCI Credit Loan Defaults - Datasheet
====================================


Motivation
==================

+ For what purpose was the dataset created?

+ Who created the dataset and on the behalf of which entity?

+ Who funded the creation of the dataset?


Composition
==================

+ What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?

+ How many instances are there in total (of each type)?

+ Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample of instances of a larger set?

+ What data does each instance consist of?

+ Is there a label or target associated with each instance?

+ Is any information missing from individual instances?

+ Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g. social network links)?

+ Are there reommended data splits (e.g. training, validation, testing)?

+ Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?*

+ Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g website, tweets, other datasets)?

+ Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g. data that is protected by legal privilege or confidentiality)?

+ Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?

+ Does the dataset relate to people?

+ Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (e.g. by age, gender)?

+ Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e. one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e in combination with other data) from the dataset?

+ Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, political opinions, genetic data)?

Collection Process
==================

+ How was the data associated with each instance acquired?

+ What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data?

+ If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy?

+ Who was involved in the data collection process?

+ Over what timeframe was the data collected?

+ Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g. IRB)?

+ Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection?

+ Did the individual in question consent to the collection and use of their data?

+ If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechansim to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?

+ Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects?

Pre-Processing
==================

+ Was any pre-processing/cleaning labeling of the data done?

+ Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned data?

+ Is the software usd to pre-process/clean/label the instances available?


Uses
==================

+ Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?

+ Is there a repositiory that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset?

+ What other tasks could the dataset be used for?

+ Is there anything about the composition of hte dataset or the way it was collected/proprocessed that might impact future uses?

+ Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?


Distribution
===================

+ Will the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity (e.g. company, institution, organization) on behalf of which the dataset was created?

+ How will the dataset be distributed (e.g. Tarball, API, GitHub)?

+ When will the datset be distributed?

+ Will the dataset be distributed under a copyright or other intellectual property (IP license and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?

+ Have any third parties imposed IP-based or otherrestrictions on the data associated with the instances?

+ Do any export controls or other regulatory restctions apply to the dataset or to individual instances?




Maintenance
==================

+ Who wil be supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?

+ How can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted?

+ Is there an erratum?
 
+ Will the dataset be updated (to correct labeling error, add new data points)?

+ If the datasets relates to people, are there applicable limits 

+ Will older versions of the dataset continue to be supported

+ If others want to extend/augment/build on the the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so?
